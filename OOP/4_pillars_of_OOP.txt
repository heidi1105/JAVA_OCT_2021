OOP
	1. Encapsulation
		onject maintains a state inside a class
		public, private, protected, default, static
		private ssn;
		private id;
	
	2. Abstraction
		(an extention of encapsulation)
		hiding the working style of an obj; only show what is required for an obj to work
		public Class Car {
			accelerate() {
				-> move gas pedal
				-> change gears in transmission
			}
		}
		Math.random()
		API
		
	3. Inheritance
		class hands down from antoher class
			extent a class
	
	4. Polymorphisism
		taking many forms
		Car -> Tesla -> model x
					 -> model y
					 -> model s
